    "## <b id=\"b2\"> Motivation</b> \n",
    "The Taylor rule was proposed by John B. Taylor in 1993. Since then a lot has been discussed about it in theoretical and emperical studies. [Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000)](http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/115/1/147.short) included lags of the policy interest rate in the equation. [Bernanke (2004)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/Speeches/2004/20040415/default.htm) showed that asset prices provide forward-looking macroeconomic information that is useful for policymakers. [Kafer (2014)](https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb02/makro/forschung/magkspapers/30-2014_kaefer.pdf) indicated that the Taylor rule should be augmented with exchange rates, asset prices, credit, and spreads. However, in recent times, many countries like Japan have abandoned traditional monetary policy based on interest rates in favour of unconventional monetary policy. In this assignment we try to investigate whether the Taylor rule is still applicable for the Japanese scenario. With some other variables added to the Taylor rule we try to emperically examine the augmented Taylor rule as well. We recently worked on creating a canon for negative interest rates along with additional members and analyzed the Japanese case in detail. In order to dwell into this topic further we decided to look the applicability of the Taylor rule. For further information about negative interest rates and it's relevance to the Japanese case you can access our canon [here](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/The-Negative-Interest-Rates-Canon.github.io/blob/master/TheNegativeInterestRateCanon.md)."

    "## <b id=\"b3\"> Methodology</b>\n",
    "We first collect data of the Interest rate (money market rate), exchange rate, consumer price rate, share price and output gap during the period 2006-16. The price gap/inflation gap is calculated by substracting the consumer price rate with the target level of inflation. As [Bask and Selander (2009)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285589504_Robust_Taylor_Rules_under_Heterogeneity_in_Currency_Trade) suggest, we include exchange rates in the Taylor rule due to the heterogeneity in currency trade in the economy. We also think Stock prices are an important factor because [Rigbon and Sack (2003)](http://web.mit.edu/rigobon/www/Robertos_Web_Page/mac_-_rmp_files/rmp.pdf) and [Fuhrer and Tootell (2008)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=887922) found that equity prices impact policy interest rates. We then run two regressions to see the impact of various factors on the interest rates by estimating the Taylor theorem and augmented Taylor theorem by both the OLS estimation and robust estimation methods."

    "### Monetary Policy Rule\n",
    "The Taylor rule states that central banks should keep in mind the inflation rate and output when setting the monetary policy. Many researchers concluded that monetary policy is conducted in line with the Taylor rule. One of the main advantages of setting the monetary policy according to the Taylor rule is the stability of the economy in combination with transparency and credibility. The policy rule has been examined for many countries in Europe. However, economic literature regarding the low or zero interest rate policy in Japan has been scarce.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Japanese Experience since the '80s\n",
    "During the 1980s the economic growth in Japan was relatively high compared to other countries. Moreover, stock and land prices were rapidly increasing, and the Japanese Yen appreciated immensely. In most cases, this would lead to a decrease in export, however, the economy including exports were not affected. However, in the late 1980s the economic bubble bursted which led to a severe recession in 1990s and early 2000. <br/><br/>\n",
    "In 1999 The Bank of Japan started a new monetary policy to tackle the low or negative economic growth, namely, zero interest policy. However, the impact of the zero interest rate policy did not lead to the desired outcome, therefore, The Bank of Japan implemented the monetary easing policy in 2001. In 2006 the quantitative easing policy ended due to signs that deflation was ending and that Japan was coming out of the recession.  <br/><br/>\n",
    "After the Subprime shock and the fall of Lehman bank, Japan experienced a huge inflow of money into the financial markets. This led to an appreciation of the yen, which damaged the Japanese economy. In 2010 The Bank of Japan again started a program of monetary easing to tackle low economic growth and deflation. At the end of 2010 The Bank of Japan implied the zero interest rate policy, which is still on till now. In 2013, a complete different policy was implemented to tackle deflation and low GDP growth, namely, Abenonomics. This program did not only focus on fiscal and monetary policy, but also on structural reforms. For instance, changes in tax systems, enhancing foundation for innovation and development. <br/><br/>\n",
    "[Olson and Wohar (2015)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e77c/8043ea45bcbd1c760a844f3f2da3cb58923d.pdf) proofed that the implementation of a simple Taylor rule could have enhanced the monetary performance in Germany. [Hove (2012)](https://www.djoef-forlag.dk/sites/nt/files/2012/2012_2.pdf) explained that the Taylor rule is different from time to time. [Ruhal (2015)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-014-0820-z) showed that the ECB policy is less stable than the German Bundesbank, which violated the Taylor rule. There have been many papers in the economic literature regarding this topic, however, the conclusions are different. We take into account the Japanese economic situation and estimate an augmented Taylor rule and investigate if the Japanese monetary policy is in line with the Taylor rule. "

    "We start by plotting the main variables of interest over time. Below we can see how the Price Gap, Output Gap, Price of Nikkie 225 index and the effective exchange rate of Japan (Yen) has varied over time from 2006 to the end of 2016. As expected the Price Gap,Output gap and the Nikkie 225 have plunged after the financial crisis of 2008. However, the Japanese Yen appreciated tremendously during the financial crisis and reached it's peak in 2012."

    "We first run a simple OLS regression for the traditional taylor rule. Thus our dependent variable is Interest rate and the independent variables are restricted to the output gap and price gap of the Japanese economy. The adjusted R-squared for the simple taylor rule model is 21%. Output gap is significant at the the 99% confidence interval but the Price gap according to this model is not statistically significant. When we extend this model to incorporate the price of the Nikkie 225 index and the exchange rate of the Yen, the adjusted R-squared jumps to 57.6%. The output gap, exchange rate and price of the index are statistically significant at the 99% confiednce interval, while the price gap in this model becomes significant at the 95% confidence interval."

    "Least square estimation models are highly sensitive to outliers or extreme observations. It is not a problem if the outlier is simply an extreme observation drawn from the tail of a normal distribution, however, if the outlier is from non-normal measurement error or some other violation of standard OLS, it compromises the validity of the regression results if a non-robust technique is employed. In our data the sample size is small, along with some outliers that do not follow the pattern of the other observations. Robust estimation (unlike maximum likelihood estimation) is not sensitive to the observation that do not follow the pattern of the other observation. Therefore we decided to use robust estimation along with the usual OLS."

    "This graph shows the predicted interest rate according to the augmented Taylor model. The results are clear, more aggressive monetary policy is needed starting from the latter part of the 2000’s. Our model predicts that the interest after the financial crisis should be in the range of 0.00 – 0.20. This is exactly what the Bank of Japan has been doing. They have been following unconventional and aggressive policies since the third quarter of 2008. The interest rates fell from 0.5% to 0.1%. In 2016, the Bank of Japan decided to enter into the unchartered territory of negative interest rates and reduce its overnight interest rate to - 0.10%."

    "##  <b id=\"b8\"> Conclusion</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This study researched if the Taylor rule is applicable to the case of Japan in the 2000s. The Taylor rule states that central banks are focusing on inflation and output when they are setting their monetary policy. This paper studied the augmented Taylor rule, which is the simple Taylor rule with some additional variables. This study concludes that most of the time the traditional Taylor rule is still appropriate, however, the exchange rate and stock indexes should be included. Furthermore, this paper concludes that a more aggressive monetary policy is needed for the second part of the 2000s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the conclusive outcome of this study, there is room for further study. The results are not conclusive for different countries, time, variables, empirical methods, etc.  In most of the new industrialized and developing countries, prices have not risen much. Therefore, different analytical methods might be needed for this.\n"
